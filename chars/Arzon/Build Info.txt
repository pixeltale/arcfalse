Arzon v1.5
Changes made 2022NOV14 by camji

- 4S now fixed for all stage
   Coder Note: This means I went and logged the bounds for ALL the stages, which means, corner only things are a GO when using var 50 - 53
- 236X now included in Wind Series
- 214X is now not cancellable
- Chording/Version Selector Adjusted (Buffer SUCKS, Still use the hold down the button to make sure you get the version you want, Works better in neutral tho)
