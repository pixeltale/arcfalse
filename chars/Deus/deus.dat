	<#bbbbbb>This move list assumes I am facing to the right.</>

	<#107105>UNIQUE TRAIT: BOUNDLESS</>
	I have many traits that make me play unlike any other character in this game.
	I can face either direction at any time. I don't have a traditional walk,
	backdash, or air dash. I can freely move back and forward in the air.
	There's even more, so check the rest of the move list for more info. :)
