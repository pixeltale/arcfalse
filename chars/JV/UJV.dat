	<#190bd9>UNIQUE TRAIT: Nálgask</>
	JV can enhance his special, remix, and super moves by
    dashing before doing them. Enhanced moves have unique,
    improved properties over their regular counterparts.

	<#190bd9>UNIQUE TRAIT: TRUE FORM</>
    Instead of using a Record Scratch cancel, UJV employs the 
   Redline Cancel, foregoing the speed boost and slowdown of scratch,
   for a faster cancel option.
   For 25 meter, JV can cancel attacks at "FREE REDLINE"
   points, even if an attack hasnt made contact.
