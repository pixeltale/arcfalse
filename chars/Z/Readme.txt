Additional Notes:
=========================
-5S is a 2 part special attack that "stores" a projectile. Performing the input again after the first part will fire the projectile that was stored.

-EX 6S will spawn a horizontal tracking projectile that needs to be manually detonated. 
To do so, input 6S for the ground detonation, and j2S for the air detonation.

-EX 2S becomes a psuedo reversal with 5 ticks of invulnerability (not from supers).

-Both versions of j6S allow you to Volt Dash after the final hit connects, consuming 1 Volt Bar.

-Blown Fuse (QCF+LMH) is fully invulnerable until the hitbox becomes active, making it possible to use as a reversal.
