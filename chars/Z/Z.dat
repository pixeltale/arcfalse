	<#25de00>UNIQUE TRAIT: VOLT CHARGE</>

	bar above his power meter. The Volt Bar will fill overtime while
	he remains grounded, and he can use it to enable his midair flight
	techniques. He can charge it faster by using 5EX. He can also empower
	his 5S and 4S using a Z Charge, which is indicated by the lightning
	bolt beside the Volt Bar.
