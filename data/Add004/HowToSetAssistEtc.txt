Ikemen Go is amazing. A lot of new features and stuff for players plus cool stuff for coders. Constants are great to customize easily any module. I implemented many constants in my TAG system so you can override any setting per character!!
First, letâ€™s learn how to declare constant. Open your char in Fighter Factory and go to the main CNS file of the char.
Below the [Movement] parameters create a new section called [Constants]
