[Options]
 ;Here you set the maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in arcade
 ;mode. The first number is the number of matches against characters with
 ;order=1, followed by order=2 and order=3 respectively. For example, for 4,3,1
 ;you will fight up to 4 randomly-picked characters who have order=1, followed
 ;by 3 with order=2 and 1 with order=3.
 ;IKEMEN feature: Max 30 orders mugen limitation is lifted.
 ;IKEMEN feature: Characters can use individual maxmatches settings (see
 ;'maxmatches' parameter in [Characters] section)

 ;Maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Arcade single mode.
arcade.maxmatches = 6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;Like arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Arcade team modes (sans 'Ratio').
team.maxmatches = 4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;Maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Time Attack mode.
timeattack.maxmatches = 6,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;IKEMEN feature: Similar to arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Survival mode.
 ;Use -1 value to choose which order number should have unlimited matches.
 ;By omitting -1 survival mode will end after particular amount of matches set
 ;below (in such case you can actually "complete" the mode).
survival.maxmatches = -1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 ;IKEMEN feature: A 'Ratio' mode allows each team to select up to 3 characters
 ;and distribute 4 "ratio levels" amongst them, affecting their life and damage
 ;(ratio 2 is the default to which other ratios are compared, percentages are
 ;adjustable in options screen).
 ;Arcade ratio matches use 'ratiomatches' configuration instead of 'maxmatches'
 ;settings. Each entry here, separated by commas, represents a single match and
 ;consists of 2 assignments, separated by colon. Assignment on the left side of
 ;colon refers to the number of characters you will face in this match (valid
 ;numbers from 1 to 3, or a random selection range, consisting of one number,
 ;followed by a dash and another number). Assignment written after colon refers
 ;to character's order param, that can be used to limit which characters should
 ;be randomly chosen for this match. For example 2-3:4 entry means a match
 ;against team of 2 or 3 characters, chosen from characters with order=4.
arcade.ratiomatches = 1-3:1, 3:1, 2:1, 2:1, 1:2, 3:1, 1-2:3

[StoryMode]
 ;Story Mode arcs declaration. Assigned arcs are selectable via Story Mode
 ;submenu ('menu.itemname.storymode' parameter in screenpack DEF file)
 ;
 ;Declaring arcs consists of setting up following parameters:
 ; - name
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set to name that should be returned by GameMode trigger.
 ;   This parameter also initiates new story arc declaration, so it has to be
 ;   assigned before any other parameter used by the same arc. All arcs should
 ;   have unique names.
 ;
 ; - displayname
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set to name that should be displayed in Story Mode submenu.
 ;
 ; - path
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Path to file with lua extension (relative to game
 ;   directory), containing story mode arc coded in Lua language.
 ;   https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/wiki/Miscellaneous-Info#arcs
 ;
 ; - unlock
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Pure Lua code, executed exactly as is, each time upon
 ;   loading main menu. If it evaluates to boolean 'true' the story arc will be
 ;   selectable from story mode submenu, or hidden on 'false'. Default: true.
 ;   https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/wiki/Miscellaneous-Info#lua_unlock
 ;
 ;Examples:
 ; name = arc1
 ; displayname = Kung Fu Story Part I
 ; path = data/story/arc1.lua
 ; unlock = true
 ;
 ; name = arc2
 ; displayname = Kung Fu Story Part II
 ; path = data/story/arc2.lua
 ; unlock = true
 ;
 ;Declare your Story Mode arcs below.
